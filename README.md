# c_web_server
This is not my first webserver but it is my first webserver written in C. It is aimed towards
a unix environment but would also work on a windows machine given some equivalent for <unistd.h>

This webserver impliments:
	- HTTP 1.0/1.1 GET and POST commands
	- Multi-threading
	- I/O Multiplexing (in progress)
	- data caps per user (based off of IP)
	- sessions (similar to PHP's $_SESSION)
	- and user logins to restricted areas

What started out as a class project has turned into a lot more and I plan to keep improving it
